## Tools

You will need an appropriate python setup installed on your machine. You should use [Conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html) as your environment manager.

The essential libraries you must have is `Librosa` which with conda can be installed with `conda install -c conda-forge librosa`

## Using Notebooks

It is **not** acceptable anymore to use `.ipynb` due to how it sucks with git. Instead, use the [Jupytext](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) format and write all notes in a `.py` file. (:clown_face: if you don't follow this)
