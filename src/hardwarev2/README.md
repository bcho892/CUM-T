# Hardware (Version used in final project)

Contains the [Altium designer](https://www.altium.com/altium-designer) files required to implement the control board.

This addresses the important issues listed in the `README` for the old hardware (located in the `hardware` folder one directory up).

To open the project you should open `hardwarev2.PrjPcb` in Altium designer, from which you can follow the [Altium documentation](https://www.altium.com/documentation/altium-designer) to export relevant schematics or gerber files (for production).
