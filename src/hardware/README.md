# Hardware (OLD VERSION)

Contains the [Altium designer](https://www.altium.com/altium-designer) files required to implement the _old_ version of the control board.

This old control board was replaced due to the following reasons:

- Lack of thermal reliefs on certain planes made hand soldering rather difficult
- Contained pads used for NPN transistors which are not needed for peltiers
- This design still required a lot of external wires which made it easy to break and harder to debug
- The layout of traces could be cleaned up a lot more

You may still use the project regularly through the project file `hardware.PrjPcb`
