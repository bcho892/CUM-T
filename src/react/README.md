# Control Interface (made with React + TypeScript + Vite)

This folder contains the required files to run the control interface for use with the CUM-T.

You need [Volta](https://docs.volta.sh/guide/getting-started) installed to be able to properly install dependencies without conflict. With such set up navigate to a terminal with the folder of this `README` open and run `yarn`.

The project is now set up! The useful commands are:

- `yarn dev` (opens a local instance of the control interface)
- `yarn build` (generates a bundle of static assets that can be used to serve in a production environment)
